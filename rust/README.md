# wtf rust
yeah i decided to run through these with the crab language as well to get some extra practice

similar to 2022, run with
```bash
cargo run --bin dayD
```
with `D` being the day number and run tests via
```bash
cargo test day_D_part_P
```
with `D` being the day number and `P` being the part number.
