superlit solutions to advent of code 2023 in a language i've literally never touched and never read about before, the gopher language

i am actively trying to read as little resources as possible so idk what the language's best practices are  
run the stuff via
```
go run ./src [day number] [part number] ("test")
```
i.e. `go run ./src 1 1` to get the solution for day 1 part 1 or `go run ./src 2 1 test` to get the solution of day 2 part 1 with test input
